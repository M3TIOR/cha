 * Just thought I'd put this here to help people save a little memory if possible.

 * that are just there to take up space... cough, cough** buildnote string **cough, cough...
 * though realistically, this can only reduce memory redundancy. if the buildnote is long
 * it's still gonna be just as long and take up just as much space...
 * then again. that's why they're originally stored as macros, so they aren't allowed to
 * consume memory where they aren't needed.
 *
 * proper usage of this optimization would look something along the lines of...

 *	#undef META_OBJECT
 * //EOF
 *---------------------------------
